        <h2>Ongoing Genocide in the Canadian Healthcare System:<br> 
Forced sterilization of First Nations and Inuit women in Canada</h2>
<br>
        <h3>Early 20th century Eugenics movement in Canada</h3>
        <p>In Canada, eugenic policies were considered progressive among many Canadian psychiatrists, philosophers, socialists and feminists. There existed a growing assumption that Canadian society could be improved by encouraging reproduction among certain groups, particularly Anglo-Saxon Protestants, and discouraging or limiting reproduction among other groups such as Indigenous peoples, as well as Eastern Europeans and Asians. <br>
	Maternal feminists such as Albertan author and legislator Nellie McClung argued that women were the mothers and guardians of their “race”, and championed for legislation, including sterilization, which aimed to curtail prostitution, alcoholism and “mental defectiveness”.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Sexual Sterilization Legislation</h3>
    <p>In 1928 and 1933, Alberta and then British Columbia passed sexual sterilization laws. Other countries who passed similar legislation around the same time are Nazi Germany. <br>
	In each province, a board of Eugenics was created with the power to authorize the sexual sterilization of certain individuals who had been institutionalized for mental diseases or defectives. <br>
	Other provinces, including Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario all drafted sexual sterilization legislation, but were never adopted. <br>
	Indigenous populations have been disproportionately targeted by sexual sterilization legislation since the 1930s. By 1972, First Nations and Métis people represented over 25 percent of those sterilized under Alberta’s sexual sterilization legislation.<br>
According to Karen Stote, author of <i>An Act of Genocide: Colonialism and the Sterilization of Aboriginal Women</i>, about 1,200 indigenous women were sterilized in the 1970s alone, about half of them in racially segregated Indian Hospitals between 1971 and 1974, despite Alberta and British Columbia’s sexual sterilization laws being repealed in 1972 and 1973.
</p>  
<br>
<h3>Institutionalized sterilization (1970s-present)</h3>
<p>Coerced sterilization and abortion have continued into the 21st century, across Canada, especially within Saskatchewan and Quebec. According to Melanie Omeniho, president of Women of the Métis Nation, over 100 indigenous women have come forward and reported horrifying experiences with forced or coerced sterilization since November 2018.</p>
<p>Tactics, used by both healthcare professionals and child and family services, include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Threatening to take away the child before it is born</li>
    <li>Physical violence, despite lack of a signed consent form and cries of protest</li>
    <li>Hiding a sterilization procedure within a consent form for another procedure (ex: C-section)</li>
    <li>Lying or leaving out important information about the reality of the procedure (ex: telling the women it is contraception or reversible)</li>
    <li>Exploitation of language barriers to get indigenous women to agree to being sterilized without understanding the severity of the procedure</li>
    <li>Pressure/harassment through repeated requests to sterilize, both inside and outside of a hospital setting (ex: repeated phone calls)</li>
    <li>Refusing to discharge a patient until they are sterilized</li>
    <li>Sterilizing a patient during an operation in which they are under anesthesia, without their knowledge (ex: c-section, bladder surgery)</li>
    <li>Presenting a tubal ligation as the only method of contraception</li>
</ul>

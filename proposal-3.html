        <h2>Ongoing Genocide in the Canadian Healthcare System:<br> 
Forced sterilization of First Nations and Inuit women in Canada</h2>
<br>
        <h3>Defintions</h3>
        <p><strong>Eugenics</strong>: A set of beliefs and practices aimed at improving the human population through controlled breeding.<br> (source: The Canadian Encylopedia)<br><br>
        <strong>"Positive" Eugenics</strong>: A form of eugenics that encourages the procreation of individuals and groups who are viewed as possessing desirable characteristics and genes. Methods include baby bonuses and other financial incentives.
        <br> (source: The Canadian Encylopedia)
        <br><br>
        <strong>"Negative" Eugenics</strong>: A form of eugenics that discourages and decreases the procreation of individuals and groups who are viewed as having inferior or undesirable characteristics and genes. Methods include sexual sterilization and institutionalization.
        <br> (source: The Canadian Encylopedia)
        <br><br>
        <strong>Sterilization</strong>: A permanent medical procedure that prevents pregnancy.<br> One example is tubal ligation, a surgical procedure in which the fallopian tubes are either cut or blocked. This procedure can be reversed through a tubal ligation reversal procedure that reconnects the fallopian tubes. If most or all the fallopian tube has been removed, or the end of the tube cut off, reversal isn’t possible. Furthermore, the pregnancy rate following a tubal ligation reversal varies from 50% to 80%.<br> Another form of sterilization is a hysterectomy (irreversible removal of the uterus).

        <br><br>
        <strong>Genocide</strong>: the intentional destruction of a particular group through killing, serious physical or mental harm, preventing births and/or forcibly transferring children to another group.
        <br> (source: The Canadian Encylopedia)
        <br><br>
        <strong>Genocide</strong>: genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
        <ul>
            <li>Killing members of the group;</li>
            <li>Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;</li>
            <li>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</li>
            <li>Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;</li>
            <li>Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</li>
        </ul>

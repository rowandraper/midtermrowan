        <h2>Ongoing Genocide in the Canadian Healthcare System:<br> 
Forced sterilization of First Nations and Inuit women in Canada</h2>
<br>
        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To amplify documented realities: ongoing structural violence and genocide by means of sterilization, either using physical force, coercion, or deception by health practitioners across Canada on indigenous women within government institutions.</li>
            <li>To additionally bring attention to the lack of media coverage and attention of the situation, as well as the lack of accountability and lawful justice</li>
            <li>Avoid interpretation and sensationalism.</li>
            <li>Simple, clean, restrained design that prioritizes clarity and respect, avoid over aestheticizing information.</li>
            <li>Format and cite information clearly.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Form</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An interactive map of Canada, detailing information on specific provinces, cities, and individuals as made publicly available by researchers. </li>
            <li>HTML narrative, giving context to the situation, including various provincial eugenics programs that existed up until the 1970s. </li>
            <li>External links to relevant <u>indigenous-led</u> initiatives</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>My place as a non-indigenous Canadain</h3>
        <p>There is an ongoing debate regarding the place of non-indigenous researchers participating in research, documentation and interpretation of indigenous realities, especially indigenous suffering, as research “about” Indigenous people without partnership can be seen as a continuation of colonial patterns. Some indigenous people even reject the idea of non-indigenous association altogether. For this reason, this project will remain private, only to be viewed within the confines of this course. For now, this project is primarily for my own personal research and education. </p>
    is Nation, over 100 indigenous women have come forward and reported horrifying experiences with forced or coerced sterilization since November 2018.</p>
